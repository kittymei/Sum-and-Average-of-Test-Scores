# Assignment
This activity consists of four programming exercises. The following exercises are open book and open note. You are free to use any written documentation you wish. However, these are individual exercises, and you cannot consult with each other in writing your programs.

This programming exercise has four parts consisting of four requirements. The grade for each requirement is indicated, for a maximum of 100 points. At a minimum, your program must compile successfully and run.

 

# Basic Difficulty
Sum of numbers
Create a console application that will accept ten numbers between 0 and 100, and report their sum.


# Average ten scores
Create a console application that will accept ten test scores between 0 and 100, average them, and report a letter grade for the average based on the usual scale. For example, a teacher will input ten test scores and see the average numerical grade and the letter grade.


# Intermediate Difficulty
Average a specific number of scores
Create a console application that will accept an arbitrary number test scores (as specified by the user) between 0 and 100, average them, and report a letter grade for the average based on the usual scale. For example, a teacher will input the total number of tests, then input ten test scores and see the average numerical grade and the letter grade.


# Advanced Difficulty
Average a non-specific number of scores
Create a console application that will accept a number test scores (as calculated by the number of scores actually entered) between 0 and 100, average them, and report a letter grade for the average based on the usual scale. For example, a teacher will input any number test scores, and see the average numerical grade and the letter grade.
